    <h3>Suān là fěn (酸辣粉), or Chongqing Hot and Sour Glass Noodle Soup, consists of a soup base layered with spicy, numbing, sour, and umami flavors, along with glass noodles and many colorful condiments. The result is a slippery, silky and crunchy texture, with little bursts of competing and complementary flavors.</h3>

    <p>Traditionally, the noodles in this dish involve a sweet sweet potato starch batter extruded through holes in a device similar to a sifter/colander. The batter “runs” directly into boiling water, which is how vendors shape and cook the noodles. For convenience, we’re going to use a Korean brand of sweet potato glass noodles that are already ready to go!</p>

    <p>This tasty hot and sour glass noodle soup has a strong, “in your face” kind of personality. It’s delicious, spicy, tangy, and satisfying. That said, feel free to adjust any of the flavors here to your own liking.</p>
