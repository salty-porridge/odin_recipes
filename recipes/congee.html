    <h1>Congee</h1>

    <h4>Congee is a classic Chinese porridge made from rice, usually served for breakfast or at dim sum. It can have sweet or savory toppings-the classic has pork, scallions, ginger, and thousand year old egg. Congee is usually made by boiling rice in a lot of water for a very long time.</h4>

    <p>For you daredevils, thrill seekers, and Andrew Zimmern types, give this recipe a try with the thousand year old egg. If less adventurous, you can always leave the egg out. And for people who grew up eating this congee, nostalgic for authentic Cantonese flavors, this one is a big welcome home with minimal effort, from me to you!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup white rice</li>
        <li>4 ounces pork shoulder <em>(115g, julienned)</em></li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>7 cups water <em>(or chicken broth; 1.65 liters)</em></li>
        <li>2 thousand year-old eggs</li>
        <li>3 slices ginger</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>Salt <em>(to taste)</em></li>
        <li>Chopped scallion and cilantro <em>(to garnish)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice, drain, and transfer to a zip-loc bag or freezer-safe container. Leave it in the freezer for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Marinate the pork with the cornstarch, oyster sauce, and vegetable oil for about 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a medium pot, bring 7 cups of water to a boil. Add the frozen rice (no need to defrost) and bring it to a boil again, stirring the rice to prevent sticking. Reduce the heat to a low simmer, and cover and cook for about 15 minutes. Periodically check and stir the congee. It’s important to stir from the bottom to prevent sticking, as the rice texture thickens quickly.</li>
        <li>While that’s cooking, dice the thousand year-old egg and set it aside. Very thinly julienne the ginger. Don’t prepare this ahead of time, as we want the flavor of freshly cut ginger.</li>
        <li>After 15 minutes, it’s time to add the julienned ginger, pork, and thousand year-old egg. Stir and simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Finally, stir in the white pepper and salt to taste. Serve piping hot with chopped scallions and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
